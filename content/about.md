Hello guys, I am Midzi, Currently a VP of Engineering at [Ajaib](https://ajaib.co.id). I have an extensive experience in building managing software engineering teams. And if I can pick one problem across all teams I built, it is about software development process.

Not about the technology we can choose or the business decision around it, the process is the most problematic thing I can state.

Let's say you have a startup with one software engineer. You can just easily plan and discuss with him the technical side, and then just develop and deliver. Of course, you want to release it as fast as possible, no matter how.

What do you think will happen? Yes, it will be delivered. But many problems will started to arise. For example, technical debt, since you want to release it fast, or when you hire another engineers, how to make all process not broken at some point.

The problem on this process will always come to you at any point in your company life. No matter how small or how big your company is.

There is an interesting concept though, called, Continuous Delivery. It is a way on building a process which allows people inside software engineering team, to release whenever they want, keep the code robust and testable, and when there is any problem with the release, you can easily fix it (some says, within 10 minutes).

And that is exactly the purpose of this blog. It is about how I, think about Continuous Delivery, and how to implement it on any scale of the company.

Nice to meet y'all!
